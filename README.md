Welcome to 5K JFS, the future of pictures. This is a simple raytracer, written in C# and developed for the course _Numerical Methods for Photorealistic Image Generation_ held by professor [Maurizio Tomasi][1] at the University of Milan, Physics Department (Academic Year 2021-2022).

The contibutors to the project are [Simone Boscolo][2], [Gabriele Crespi][3] and [Matteo Macchini][4].

## Features

## Requirements

5K JFS requires [.NET 6.0.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) to run. the library does not work with lower versions.

[ImageSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SixLabors.ImageSharp/2.1.1), [CommandLineUtils](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.CommandLineUtils), [NetCore.Platforms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.Platforms/7.0.0-preview.3.22175.4) and [ShellProgressBar](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ShellProgressBar/). Don't worry, they will be installed automatically when the repository is downloaded

is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Usage

In order to use the library you can clone this repository through the command

    git clone git@github.com:simoneboscolo99/5K_JFS.git
    
Alternatively, you can download the latest version of the code from the [releases page](https://github.com/simoneboscolo99/5K_JFS/releases).

To check that the code works as expected, you can run the suite of tests using the following command:

    dotnet test

To get command-line help for the usage, simply run

    dotnet run

### Render mode

You can create your own images throug this mode: it reads an external file describing the scene to render. Here you can easily learn how to write such a file. In order to use the render mode, you can go to the 5K_JFS/5K_JFS directory and run the following command

    dotnet run -- render [arguments] [options]
    
The only argument for the render command is the path of the input file describing the scene. The user can find here some examples of input files. To view all the possible options just run
    
    dotnet run -- render -?
    
Available shapes are:
- Spheres
- Planes
- Boxes
- Disks
- Open cylinders
- Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG): union, difference and intersection of any pair of shapes mentioned above

    

### Demo mode

    dotnet run -- demo [options]
    
some words
    
    dotnet run -- demo -?

### Convert mode ðŸ”„

    dotnet run -- convert [options]
    
To view all the possible options run
    
    dotnet run -- convert -?
